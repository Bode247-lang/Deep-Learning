    "In this exercise, you will learn how to create your own chatbot by modifying the code provided in the example in our course. You will need to choose a topic that you want your chatbot to be based on and find a text file related to that topic. Then, you will need to modify the code to preprocess the data in the text file and create a chatbot interface that can interact with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Choose a topic: Choose a topic that you are interested in and find a text file related to that topic. You can use websites such as Project Gutenberg to find free text files.\n",
    "Preprocess the data: Modify the preprocess() function in the code provided to preprocess the data in your text file. You may want to modify the stop words list or add additional preprocessing steps to better suit your needs.\n",
    "Define the similarity function: Modify the get_most_relevant_sentence() function to compute the similarity between the user's query and each sentence in your text file. You may want to modify the similarity metric or add additional features to improve the performance of your chatbot.\n",
    "Define the chatbot function: Modify the chatbot() function to return an appropriate response based on the most relevant sentence in your text file.\n",
    "Create a Streamlit app: Use the main() function in the code provided as a template to create a web-based chatbot interface. Prompt the user for a question, call the chatbot() function to get the response, and display it on the screen.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your code, you need to have the text file in the same directory as your Python script.\n",

    "You may want to test your chatbot with different types of questions to ensure that it is working correctly.\n",

    "Conclusion :\n",
    "In summary, the code provided defines a simple chatbot using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Streamlit. The chatbot is designed to provide answers to questions related to a specific topic, as described in a text file.\n",
    "The code consists of several functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tpreprocess(): This function preprocesses a sentence by tokenizing it into words, removing stopwords and punctuation, and lemmatizing the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tget_most_relevant_sentence(): This function finds the most relevant sentence in the text file given a user query. It does this by computing the similarity between the query and each sentence in the text file and returning the sentence with the highest similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tchatbot(): This function uses the get_most_relevant_sentence() function to get the most relevant sentence for a given user question and returns it as the chatbot's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tmain(): This function creates a Streamlit app that provides a user interface for the chatbot. It prompts the user to enter a question and displays the chatbot's response on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the chatbot is a simple example of how NLTK and Streamlit can be used to create a conversational interface for answering questions related to a specific topic. With further development and refinement, the chatbot could be made more robust and capable of answering a wider range of questions.\n",
